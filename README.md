## Information

Below, you will find the technical information needed to complete the assignment. You do not have to use the specific pixels listed, translating to a relative unit is fine. Please add your solution into the `./src` directory.

The error depicted in the design is meant to communicate a state, so this should be built as validation on each form field.
